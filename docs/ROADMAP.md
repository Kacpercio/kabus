## Kabus Marketplace Script Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, improvements, and milestones for the Kabus Marketplace Script built with Laravel 11 and PHP 8.3.

On January 1st, I created the Kabus Marketplace Script repository, marking the beginning of its development. The first stable release (v1.0) is scheduled for April 4th and will include the core features needed to make it a functional and reliable marketplace.

### Milestones

#### February 2nd Goals (v0.8)
- [X] Make the referral system optional during user registration instead of mandatory.
- [X] Write clear and comprehensible documentation for Kabus Marketplace Script.
- [X] Develop a shopping cart system and enable adding products to the cart.
- [X] Write a comprehensive "How to Buy Monero" guide.

#### March 3rd Goals (v0.9)
- [X] Finalize advertisement payments and vendor application system with Monero payment integration.
- [ ] Implement 'My Sales' for vendors and 'My Orders' for buyers.
- [X] Write a comprehensive guide for using Kleopatra.
- [X] Finish functionality for creating and editing digital, cargo and dead drop products.

#### April 4th Goals (v1.0)
- [ ] Implement a feature to allow users and vendors to create and manage disputes.
- [ ] Add product review functionality.
- [ ] Integrate optional Baklava CAPTCHA.
- [ ] Add walletless escrow mechanism for buying products, making the script fully functional.

After the final release of Kabus Marketplace Script, I will stop adding new features and will focus solely on long-term support—updating PHP and Laravel versions, and performing bug fixes and security enhancements.

Following the first release, I will begin developing a paid Monero marketplace script called **"Karabasan"**. This new script will offer improved marketplace functions, enhanced security measures, and a better user experience.
